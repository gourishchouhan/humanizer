# Humanizer App

This application changes text generated by AI so it sounds more like it was written by a person. It helps make AI content more natural and engaging.

## Why Humanize AI Content?

AI-written text is often accurate but can lack the natural feel and emotional tone of human writing. Our Humanizer App aims to fix this by:

* **Making it Authentic:** Helping AI content feel more genuine.
* **Improving Connection:** Adding a human touch to the text.
* **Personalizing Content:** Adjusting the style to match a specific voice or brand.

## Our Technology

This project uses a direct and efficient set of tools for building and running the app:

* **Frontend (User Interface):** We use **Next.js**. This helps display the app quickly and efficiently, especially when deployed.
* **Design Tools:** We use **Tailwind CSS** for basic styling.
* **Backend (Server Logic):** We use **Hono**. This is a fast tool for handling requests and connecting to the AI.
* **AI Model:** We use **Google Gemini Pro API**. This is the AI that actually rewrites the text to sound more human.
* **Hosting (Where the App Lives):** We use **Vercel** to host both the user interface and the backend, making it easy to run the app online.
* **Database (Optional for now):** For the initial version, we don't need a database. If we add features like user accounts or saving past work, we would use tools like **Supabase** or **Turso**.
* **Protecting Instructions:** The specific instructions we give to the AI to "humanize" the text are kept private. They are stored securely and not visible to the public.

## How It Works

1.  **You Provide Text:** You paste your AI-generated text into the app.
2.  **App Sends Text:** The app sends this text to our secure backend.
3.  **AI Rewrites Text:** Our backend combines your text with our private "humanizing" instructions and sends it to the Gemini AI.
4.  **You Get Humanized Text:** The Gemini AI rewrites the text, and the app shows you the new, more human-sounding version.
